I starded to learn JavaEE uging book «Java EE 7 Essentials» by Arun Gupta (in Russian). I downloaded NetBeans Java EE from https://netbeans.org/downloads/ and have to install it.
Note: I had some problem with installation but I resolved this issue using «OS Independent Zip» for download.

Jan 10, 2017

I downloaded zip file from http://glassfish.org/hol/movieplex7-starting-template.zip and took and opened folder movieplex7 in Netbeans as project. I tried to start project but NetBeans didn't find server for it.

Jan 11, 2017

I figured out how to create and run the GlassFish Server (Services tab).
However, when the project starts getting error - error in the deployment: Invalid target ID Server. I need to continue to explore this...

Jan 12, 2017

I can not understand what the problem is...
GlassFish server is starting successfully, project is building successfully,
but I'm getting message: The module has not been deployed. See the server log for details.
I continue to look for - what's the problem?

Jan 13, 2017

I decided to change tactic.
I'll postpone the book «Java EE 7 Essentials» and try to make more simple project in Java EE - for example https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/javaee-gettingstarted_ru.html
By the way, I tried to create some simple applications but failed...

Jan 14, 2017

I'm at home. I found out that on the home computer any projects NetBeans was created successfully.
I started to create my first java web application https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/javaee-gettingstarted.html

Jan 15, 2017

I finished writing a simple application on the model of the article.
Application building passes without errors. But the application does not work: the module is not deployed.

I tryed to start SimpleEE7App.war using Administration Console (http://localhost:4848) but failed...

Jan 16, 2017

I tried to open SimpleEE7App which I made at home but failed.
NetBean does not want to open the project. I think I should try to use another IDE maybe Eclipse...

Jan 17, 2017

I have read http://webjavastart.blogspot.ru then installed Eclipse (4.6.2)+Tomcat (9.0) and created simple Dynamic Web Projects HelloWorld and SimpleServlet. All work fine.

Jan 19, 2017

I have read http://java-online.ru/jsp.xhtml about Java Server Pages (JSP) and wrote example JavaBeanExample.
In parrallel I started to read a book «Thinking In Java Enterprise» by Bruce Eckel http://javatutor.net/books/tiej

I continued to read the book and studied simple server and client.

Jan 21, 2017

I studied simple multithreading server and client.

Jan 22, 2017

I studied simple Java applets.
And I decided temporary to skip parts about multiplexing and RMI and went directly to JDBC part.

Jan 23, 2017

I studied the chapter, which describes the work with the database (sqlite).

Jan 24, 2017

I started to learn chapter about Servlets and made first simple Servlet.

I finished to learn chapter about JSP and started to learn chapter about Custom Tags.

Feb 4, 2017

I made first simple example with Custom Tags and JSP.

Feb 5, 2017

I tried to use JavaBean + Custom Tags but failed.
Perhaps there is an error in the book or something is not written until the end. I'll to understand with it tomorrow.

Feb 6, 2017

I spent a lot of time to deal with the couple:
	<tijtags:GreetingTag id="randomgreeting" />
	<jsp:getProperty name="randomgreeting" property="greeting" />
but, unfortunately, this fragment did not become work. I replaced the call tag:
	<jsp:useBean id="randomgreeting" class="tags.GreetingBean" />
	<jsp:getProperty name="randomgreeting" property="greeting" />
And I got the necessary result in the browser. Nowever I understand that here must work other technology. I need to move on...

And tried to do simple example from http://blog.eros2.info/2009/04/ejb-3.html (http://www.quizful.net/post/ejb-eclipse-example for next)

Feb 11, 2017

Installed JBoss in Eclipse at home using advices from http://theopentutorials.com/tutorials/java-ee/installing-jboss-tools-in-eclipse/ And yes, again confirmed that JBoss didn't work with Java 8. So I installed JDK 1.7. After start JBoss added user (add-user.bat) and took a look at Administration Console.

Feb 12, 2017

Today and day before I learned this article http://theopentutorials.com/examples/java-ee/ejb3/how-to-create-a-simple-ejb3-project-in-eclipse-jboss-7-1/ (in English) and I was able to start the first EJB and the client for it successfully.
