I starded to learn JavaEE uging book «Java EE 7 Essentials» by Arun Gupta (in Russian). I downloaded NetBeans Java EE from https://netbeans.org/downloads/ and have to install it.
Note: I had some problem with installation but I resolved this issue using «OS Independent Zip» for download.

I downloaded zip file from http://glassfish.org/hol/movieplex7-starting-template.zip and took and opened folder movieplex7 in Netbeans as project. I tried to start project but NetBeans didn't find server for it.

I figured out how to create and run the GlassFish Server (Services tab).
However, when the project starts getting error - error in the deployment: Invalid target ID Server. I need to continue to explore this...

I can not understand what the problem is...
GlassFish server is starting successfully, project is building successfully,
but I'm getting message: The module has not been deployed. See the server log for details.
I continue to look for - what's the problem?
