I starded to learn JavaEE uging book «Java EE 7 Essentials» by Arun Gupta (in Russian). I downloaded NetBeans Java EE from https://netbeans.org/downloads/ and have to install it.
Note: I had some problem with installation but I resolved this issue using «OS Independent Zip» for download.

Jan 10, 2017

I downloaded zip file from http://glassfish.org/hol/movieplex7-starting-template.zip and took and opened folder movieplex7 in Netbeans as project. I tried to start project but NetBeans didn't find server for it.

Jan 11, 2017

I figured out how to create and run the GlassFish Server (Services tab).
However, when the project starts getting error - error in the deployment: Invalid target ID Server. I need to continue to explore this...

Jan 12, 2017

I can not understand what the problem is...
GlassFish server is starting successfully, project is building successfully,
but I'm getting message: The module has not been deployed. See the server log for details.
I continue to look for - what's the problem?

Jan 13, 2017

I decided to change tactic.
I'll postpone the book «Java EE 7 Essentials» and try to make more simple project in Java EE - for example https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/javaee-gettingstarted_ru.html
By the way, I tried to create some simple applications but failed...

Jan 14, 2017

I'm at home. I found out that on the home computer any projects NetBeans was created successfully.
I started to create my first java web application https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/javaee-gettingstarted.html

Jan 15, 2017

I finished writing a simple application on the model of the article.
Application building passes without errors. But the application does not work: the module is not deployed.

I tryed to start SimpleEE7App.war using Administration Console (http://localhost:4848) but failed...

Jan 16, 2017

I tried to open SimpleEE7App which I made at home but failed.
NetBean does not want to open the project. I think I should try to use another IDE maybe Eclipse...

Jan 17, 2017

I have read http://webjavastart.blogspot.ru then installed Eclipse (4.6.2)+Tomcat (9.0) and created simple Dynamic Web Projects HelloWorld and SimpleServlet. All work fine.
