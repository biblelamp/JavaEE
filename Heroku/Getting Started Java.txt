Introduction

This tutorial will have you deploying a Java app in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of Heroku.

The tutorial assumes that you have:
* a free Heroku account.
* Java 8 installed locally.
* Maven 3 installed locally.

If you’d prefer to use Gradle instead of Maven, please see the Getting Started with Gradle on Heroku guide.
